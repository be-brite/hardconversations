# Auto Moderator

You are a developer for a company called Inbreddit, an alt-right clone of a popular website. Communities within Inbreddit can have their own rules. You've been tasked with building a feature that will automatically detect if a post is likely to break the rules of a community and to flag which rules and why to the end user.
